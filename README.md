### Unit Four Here We Come!

---

Guess what? It is the final unit of WDI before you officially cross the threshold into the tech industry! Holy cow!

To prepare you, this unit is structured unlike any other unit. Instead of being assigned daily homework, you will spend the next two weeks building, tweaking, and deploying applications (new and old).

During this time, you are expected to deliver three applications (each in their own github repo):
  * Personal Portfolio Website
  * Rails Fullstack Application
  * Independent Application of your choosing

See below for more details!

### Required Applications:

---

- **Rails Fullstack Application**: You will receive instructions during Unit 4 lectures to complete this application. (**due on 06/11/2017**)

- **Personal Portfolio Website**, which must include:
  * 4-5 Completed Projects with links to the github/deployed version
  * Be under a professional domain name
  * Mobile First Design
  * Clean Commented Code

- **Independent Application**: Using any pattern and tech stack of your choice, create an application that can be used as a portfolio piece and presented during our cohort final project science fair! (**Approval times TBD**)

### Expectations
---
To get through the above requirements will take time management, dedication, and passion. It is also a **graduation requirement that all of the tasks above are completed,** so make sure to take this seriously.

Every minute over the next couple of weeks must be planned/used wisely, so jump in and make us proud. We believe in you!
