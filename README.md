EVERYTHING IS PROGRESS

This app is intended for people who suffer with any level of depression. Sometimes it can be hard to get motivated to do ANYTHING to feel better when you're depressed. This app allows users to log all of the little wins they have throughout the day - whether it's going to therapy, calling a friend, exercising, or even just getting into the shower. Each activity gets points, so you can track how you were feeling from day to day and use this as a resource to discuss your week with your therapist.

DISCLAIMER
I am not a doctor or mental health professional of any kind. I am a web developer, making this free app to fill a personal need and sharing for anyone interested. If you think you may be suffering from depression, seek help from a mental health professional. This tool is in no way a substitute for treatment.
