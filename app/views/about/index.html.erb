  <h1>About this app</h1>
  <div id="about">
    <h4>Everyone who suffers from depression knows that getting up and doing activities can make you feel better, but it's hard to find the inspiration to do so when you're really suffering.</h4>
    <h4>I created this app because it was something I would have found useful on my worst days.</h4>
    <h4>I'm not a doctor. I'm not a mental health professional. This app is something I created as a tool to inspire myself and to better communicate with my therapist. </h4>
    <h4>THIS APP IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THERAPY. </h4>
    <h4>I urge you to seek professional help if you're suffering.</h4>
