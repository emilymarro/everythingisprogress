### Unit Four Here We Come!

---

Guess what? It is the final unit of WDI before you officially cross the threshold into the tech industry! Holy cow!

To prepare you, this unit is structured unlike any other unit. Instead of being assigned daily homework, you will spend the next two weeks building, tweaking, and deploying applications (new and old).

During this time, you are expected to deliver three applications (**each in their own github repo**):
  * Personal Portfolio Website
  * Rails CRUD Application
  * Independent Application of your choosing

See below for more details!

### Required Applications:

- **Rails CRUD Application** _with at least 2 tables_ in your database. (**due on 10/04/2017**)

- **Personal Portfolio Website**(suggested due date 10/10/2017), which must include:
  * 4-5 Completed Projects with links to the github/deployed version
  * Be under a professional domain name
  * Mobile First Design
  * Clean Commented Code

- **Independent Application**: Using any pattern and tech stack of your choice, create an application that can be used as a portfolio piece and presented during our cohort final project science fair! (**Approval times TBD**)
> Note: The aim for the final project is to build something that will push you. Try to think of a project that interests you. The requirements are fairly relaxed (e.g. you can use any tech stack you want). A typical project would be a full stack CRUD app that uses one front-end framework and one 3rd party API.

#### Accountability buddy:
In our experience, we found that it's really helpful to have a partner that would kee you accountable and stay on track.
Hence, we paired you up! You fill find a document with pairs in this repo.

Meet with each other every morning and do a mini stand up and answer the questions: 
* What have you accomplished yesterday?
* What do you plan to deliver by the end of the day?
* What a some challenges? And what resources are needed to overcome them? 

### Expectations
---
To get through the above requirements will take time management, dedication, and passion. It is also a **graduation requirement that all of the tasks above are completed,** so make sure to take this seriously.

Every minute over the next couple of weeks must be planned/used wisely, so jump in and make us proud. We believe in you!!!
